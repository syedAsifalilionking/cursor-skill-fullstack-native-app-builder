# Cursor Skill — Full-Stack Native App Builder

A comprehensive Cursor AI skill for building production-ready apps across three platforms:

- **Node.js CMS** — Monolithic Express server with EJS views, Firebase or Supabase backend
- **iOS** — SwiftUI + MVVM with Firebase, OpenAI, StoreKit 2
- **Android** — Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + MVVM with Firebase, OpenAI, Google Play Billing

All three platforms share the same Firebase backend and follow consistent architectural patterns.

## How It Works

When you ask Cursor to build something, the skill activates based on your request:

- **"Build me a CMS"** → Loads `references/cms/cms-skill.md`
- **"Create an iOS app"** → Loads `references/ios/ios-skill.md`
- **"Build an Android app"** → Loads `references/android/android-skill.md`
- **"Build a full-stack app"** → Loads all three as needed

Each platform skill references deeper documentation files for specific features (Firebase, OpenAI, subscriptions, widgets, etc.), which are loaded only when needed.

---

## Example Prompts

Here are example prompts you can use in Cursor to trigger this skill:

- "Create a recipe sharing platform with a CMS to manage content, plus native iOS and Android apps"
- "Build a habit tracker with a Node.js admin panel, an iPhone app, and an Android app"

### CMS / Admin Panel Only

- "Build me a CMS for managing blog posts with Firebase backend"
- "Create an admin dashboard with user management, content CRUD, and file uploads using Supabase"
- "Build a Node.js admin panel with dark mode, login lockout, and role-based access"

### iOS App Only

## Important Notes & Warnings

### Firebase Billing — Be Careful with Costs

Firebase bills based on usage. A misconfigured app can generate unexpected costs very quickly.

**Firestore reads are the most common cost trap:**
- Every `.get()`, every `.onSnapshot()` listener tick, every query counts as reads
- A dashboard that queries 5 collections on load = 5 reads per user per page load
- A realtime listener that fires on every document change in a large collection can generate thousands of reads per minute
- **Widgets that refresh every 15-30 minutes multiply this** — each widget refresh triggers reads

**How to protect yourself:**
- **Set budget alerts** in Google Cloud Console → Billing → Budgets & Alerts. Set alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of your expected monthly budget
- **Set daily spend limits** on Firebase if available, or use Google Cloud billing caps
- **Use Firestore cache-first pattern** — query `Source.CACHE` before server to reduce reads
- **Avoid listening to entire collections** — always filter with `.where()` and `.limit()`
- **Paginate everything** — never load all documents at once
- **Use `getDocuments()` instead of `addSnapshotListener()` when realtime is not needed**
- **Monitor usage daily** in Firebase Console → Usage & Billing during the first weeks after launch

**Cloud Functions:**
- Every HTTP request to a Cloud Function counts as an invocation
- If your CMS serves all traffic through a Cloud Function (`rewrites: "**" → app`), every page load, every API call, every static asset request is an invocation
- Serve static assets from Firebase Hosting directly (not through the function)
- Set `timeoutSeconds` and `memory` appropriately — don't over-provision

**Storage:**
- Downloads are billed — if you serve images directly from Firebase Storage URLs without a CDN, every image view = a download
- Use signed URLs with long expiry or put a CDN (Cloudflare, etc.) in front of Storage

### Notification Limits — Firebase Cloud Messaging

FCM itself is free and has no hard sending limit, but be aware:

- **Firestore writes from notifications:** If your app writes to Firestore when a notification is received or opened (logging analytics, updating read status), those writes count toward your Firestore bill
- **Scheduled local notifications are free** — they run entirely on-device and don't involve Firebase at all
- **Topic messaging** is more efficient than sending to individual tokens when targeting many users
- **Don't spam users** — too many notifications lead to uninstalls, which is worse than any billing issue

### Firebase Spending Controls

Firebase does **not** automatically stop your project when you exceed your budget. The budget alerts only send notifications — **your app continues running and accumulating charges** until you manually take action.

**To actually limit spending:**
1. Set up **budget alerts** at multiple thresholds (50%, 80%, 100%)
2. Create a **Cloud Function or Cloud Monitoring alert** that automatically disables billing or scales down when a threshold is hit
3. Alternatively, use **Google Cloud billing export to BigQuery** and monitor with dashboards
4. Consider starting on the **Spark (free) plan** during development and only upgrading to Blaze when you need it
5. On the Blaze plan, set a **programmatic billing cap** using the Cloud Billing API

**Example: Auto-disable billing when budget exceeded:**
```javascript
// Cloud Function triggered by budget alert pub/sub
exports.stopBilling = functions.pubsub
  .topic('billing-alerts')
  .onPublish(async (message) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(message.data, 'base64').toString());
    if (data.costAmount > data.budgetAmount) {
      // Disable billing via Cloud Billing API
      // Or: disable Cloud Functions, scale down, etc.
      // IMPORTANT: This will take your app offline
    }
  });
```

### OpenAI API Costs

- Set **usage limits** in the OpenAI dashboard (Settings → Limits → Monthly budget)
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` for simple tasks (10x cheaper than `gpt-4o`)
- Cache AI responses locally — don't re-fetch the same recommendations daily
- **Vision API calls are expensive** — compress images before sending (JPEG 70% quality)
- Limit free users to a small number of AI requests per day/month
- Track usage per user in Firestore to enforce limits

### App Store / Play Store Subscriptions

- **Always test with sandbox/test accounts** before going live
- **Apple:** Sandbox subscriptions renew every few minutes (not monthly) — don't confuse this with real behavior
- **Google:** Use test card numbers and license testing accounts
- **Always implement restore purchases** — both stores require it
- **Sync subscription state to Firestore** so your CMS can read it — don't rely solely on client-side checks
- **Handle grace periods and billing retry** — a user in grace period should still have access
